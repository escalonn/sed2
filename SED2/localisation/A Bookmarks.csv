BM_THE_MONGOLS;Jerusalem at Its Height;;;;;;;;;;;;;
HIGH_MED_INFO;Jerusalem stands strong and proud. The Principality of Antioch has been absorbed and the Kingdom has expanded inland, toward the Sinai peninsula and Damascus. Although Jerusalem’s size and strength goes a long way to secure Catholic dominance in the Levant, everything is far from guaranteed. Damascus and Aleppo still stand as guards against the massive Seljuk Sultanate to the East, and the Fatimid Caliph smarts over the losses Egypt suffered during the First Crusade. Jerusalem has many enemies, and few friends. In the distance, a scream for Jihad sounds…;;;;;;;;;;;;;

BM_100_YEARS_WAR;The Latin Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;;
LATE_MED_INFO;The notorious and ill fated Fourth Crusade, which was supposed to retake Jerusalem after an invasion through Egypt, was instead derailed by scheming Venetians, corrupt leaders and the deposed Byzantine Emperor Alexios IV, seeking to regain his lost throne. The result was the tragic sack of Constantinople and the subsequent establishment of the Latin Empire. Almost none of the Crusaders even reached the Holy Land. Meanwhile, the infamous King John, brother of Richard the Lionheart, rules in England, and the Christian states of Spain face off against the powerful Almohad dynasty.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
