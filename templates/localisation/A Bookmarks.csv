BM_JERUSALEM_DESC   ;Jerusalem stands strong and proud. The Principality of Antioch has been absorbed and the Kingdom has expanded inland, toward the Sinai peninsula and Damascus. Although Jerusalem's size and strength goes a long way to secure Catholic dominance in the Levant, everything is far from guaranteed. Damascus and Aleppo still stand as guards against the massive Seljuk Sultanate to the East, and the Fatimid Caliph smarts over the losses Egypt suffered during the First Crusade. Jerusalem has many enemies, and few friends. In the distance, a scream for Jihad sounds....;Jerusalem stands strong and proud.

The Turks still reigned in the Middle East and Persia, in India many new kingdoms vied for power after the fall of the old dynasties. The Norman conquest had brought new political and dynastic struggles to England and France, the Christian kingdoms in Spain were continually growing stronger, Scandinavia had left paganism behind and was becoming more centralized. In Russia several principalities struggled for power in the shadow of the Bolghars and Cumans to the east. In Germany and Italy, the Holy Roman Empire still stood firm, but beyond all this, to the east, a new power was to come into play. When the Mongols broke into Eastern Europe and Persia, it changed the balance of power in all of Western Eurasia...

LATE_MED_INFO       ;The notorious and ill fated Fourth Crusade, which was supposed to retake Jerusalem after an invasion through Egypt, was instead derailed by scheming Venetians, corrupt leaders and the deposed Byzantine Emperor Alexios IV, seeking to regain his lost throne. The result was the tragic sack of Constantinople and the subsequent establishment of the so called Latin Empire. Almost none of the Crusaders even reached the Holy Land. Meanwhile, the infamous King John, brother of Richard the Lionheart, rules in England, and the Christian states of Spain face off against the powerful Almohad dynasty.;The notorious and ill fated Fourth Crusade, which was supposed to retake Jerusalem after an invasion through Egypt, was instead derailed by scheming Venetians, corrupt leaders and the deposed Byzantine Emperor Alexios IV, seeking to regain his lost throne.

Meanwhile, the infamous King John, brother of Richard the Lionheart, rules in England, and the Christian states of Spain face off against the powerful Almohad dynasty.;;;Europe in the Late Middle Ages was a very different place compared to a few hundred years earlier. Spain was dominated by the Christian kingdoms, the Muslim rulers only clinging on in the south. The Holy Roman Empire still dominated Central Europe next to a strong Hungary, while in France and England dynastic conflicts with roots in the Norman conquest were to lead to long and bloody wars. The Golden Horde and the Ilkhanate dominated the Steppes and Persia, forcing every ruler between Central Europe and India to take the Mongols into account. The Tughluq dynasty ruled an immense empire in India, while North Africa was divided between various Arab dynasties. Turkish domination in the Middle East seemed to have been ended by the Mongol conquests, but in Anatolia a dynasty known as the Ottomans was stirring...
