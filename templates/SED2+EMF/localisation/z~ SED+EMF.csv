Rumors carried across the Silk Road and the Indian Ocean have told of how Genghis Khan and his invincible Mongol hordes shattered the greatest empires of the known world, from Cathay to Persia. Though Genghis Khan is now dead, the sons and grandsons of Genghis intend to continue his conquests. They have their eyes upon Europe and the rest of the Middle East, and the entire world may be united under the banner of Genghis if his descendants do not end up fighting among themselves, that is. Perhaps the end of days has finally come at last, a punishment for the sins of the wicked or perhaps this is Gods greatest test yet for the faithful.;;;;
