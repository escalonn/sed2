apostolic;Armenian Apostolic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
apostolic_DESC;Sometimes referred to as “Gregorian,” this was one of the early Christian faiths, founded in Armenia by the Apostles Bartholomew and Thaddeus.

haruri_DESC;The Haruri are a sect from the period of the Rashidun Caliphs, named for their first leader, Habib ibn-Yazid al-Haruri. The Haruri were originally one branch of the Kharijite “Rejectors” movement, so called because they rejected Ali’s right to the Caliphate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ismaili;Isma‘ili;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ismaili_DESC;The Isma‘ili believe that, when the 6th Imam, Ja‘far al-Sadiq died, his true successor was not Musa al-Kazim as the others believe, but in fact was the already dead Isma‘il and his son Muhammad. The line of Isma‘il has been in hiding for years, but now has emerged to reclaim the Caliphate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mahdiyya;Mahdist;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mahdiyya_DESC;The Mahdists believe that the messiah, or Mahdi, has already risen, and given his commandments that clarify the Quran such that no other interpretation is valid. They are led by their own Caliphate of successors to the Mahdi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mandaean_DESC;Mandaeism is a gnostic religion with a strongly dualistic worldview. Its adherents revere Adam, Abel, Seth, Enos, Noah, Shem, Aram and especially John the Baptist, but reject Abraham, Moses and Jesus of Nazareth. It is represented in-game as an early form of Manichaeism, and a potential heresy should it resurface.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
manichean_DESC;Manichaeism is a Gnostic religion founded by the prophet Mani, who was put to death by the Sassanid Shahanshah Bahram I in 277.

maronite_DESC;Beginning as a movement founded by the monk Maron in the fourth century, the Maronites are a Christian Church in full communion with the Holy See yet under the leadership of the Maronite Patriarch.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_DESC;The Messalians, or Euchites (“those who pray”), are a heretical Christian sect that originated in Mesopotamia, influenced by dualistic faiths like Zoroastrianism. Messalians believe that God can be perceived by the carnal senses, and that this perception is necessary to reach perfection. Each person is born with an inner demon, and only intense prayer can drive it out. They also believe that Lucifer is the elder son of God and a force for good, and that incest is sacred since it was practised by the children of Adam and Eve. They have no formal rites and no strict church hierarchy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
monophysite_DESC;Monophysitism is an early Christian heresy which states that Christ had but a single nature.

nabawiyya_DESC;The Nabawites believe that the Quran was only the holy book for the Arabs, and that they have their own holy book and prophet, just as legitimate, sent by God for their people, modelled on Islam. They are led by a Malik, similar to the Muslim Caliph.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
nestorian_DESC;Nestorianism is an early Christian branch which states that Christ has two separate natures – one divine and one human. This is the opposite of the Monophysite position where Christ has but a single nature. The nominal head of the Nestorian Church is the Patriarch of the East.\n§Y*§! Learned Nestorians may subscribe to the Antiochian school of theology.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
paulician_DESC;Paulicianism is a Christian Gnostic heresy influenced by Manichaeism, originating in Armenia, and known for its militarist attitude and emphasis on only accepting the New Testament as legitimate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
qarmatian;Qarmatian;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
qarmatian_DESC;The Qarmatians are a extreme splinter sect of Isma‘ili Islam, and believe that there are seven ages of man, each with a new religion and prophet, and the final age is approaching. They believe that the rest of the Isma‘ilis have lost the faith, and that Muhammad son of Isma‘il is still in hiding, waiting to return as the Mahdi.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
tondrakian_DESC;The Tondrakians are an anti-feudal, anti-church sect that originally flourished in Armenia between the 9th and 11th centuries. They denied the immortality of the soul, the afterlife, and the rights of the church to rule over its fellow man. They supported property rights for peasants and equality between men and women.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
waqifi_DESC;The Waqifites believe that the Imamate has ended before the main branch of Shi‘ism has accepted it. To the Waqifites, the final Imam is the Mahdi who will return at the end of days, and they wait faithfully for him.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zaydi_DESC;The Zaydis are a Shi‘a group that believe that the Alid Imams are not infallible, but are divinely inspired and have a responsibility to lead rebellion against corrupt authority. Nor is the Imamate hereditary. Any Alid who rises up in rebellion can become an Imam.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zurvanist;Zurvanite;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
zurvanist_DESC;Zurvanism is a branch of Zoroastrianism that believes in the existence of Zurvan, a sexless god of of infinite time (and space), for whom there is no distinction between good and evil. Zurvan is the parent of the two opposites representing the good god, Ahura Mazda, and the evil Angra Mainyu, unlike normal Zoroastrianism, for which Ahura Mazda is the supreme being. Zurvanism is further divided by its three schools of thought: Aesthetic, fatalistic and materialistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

bureaucratic_infighting_desc;If a ruler’s court grows out of his control, the results can be devastating. It’s entirely possible for the empire to fly apart at the seams. Even if it doesn’t, it will become increasingly difficult for the ruler to exert influence over members of his court – or keep them within the empire after his death.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infighting_0_desc;The court is currently out of control, with rulers all but ignoring the throne’s authority as they vie with each other for greater power and influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
infighting_1_desc;Order has been restored in the ruler’s court, with authority from the crown once again being respected.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_group_desc;In its inception, the Bogomil faith was only loosely organized. It didn’t believe in formal churches, and opposed any kind of formal hierarchy – indeed, the hierarchy and tyranny of the Orthodox Church is partly what prompted its creation. Its anarchical nature also makes the faithful difficult to control with the traditional feudal structure. It is possible, however, for a powerful Bogomil ruler to slowly organize and reform the faith into something permanent and lasting… but it will not be easy, and the common folk are likely to resist any such attempt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_0;No Bogomil Organization;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_0_desc;The Bogomil faith is a movement which exists independent of, and sometimes opposed to, the structure of a feudal state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_1;Bogomilism Supported;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_1_desc;The Bogomil faithful recognize that feudal rulers are on their side, and are willing to co-operate to a large extent. The missionary work of the Perfecti is supported by the state, but beyond that the faithful still resist any notion of formal organization.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_2_desc;The Bogomil faith now has a standardized set of liturgy and texts, and the various members of the movement have agreed to work together – and not oppose their feudal rulers. They still operate outside of formal temples, and they still operate seperately from the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_3_desc;The Bogomil faith now operates out of temples, and are willing to work directly with feudal rulers in their councils. They have been entwined enough with the state that there is no lingering sense of opposition – as far as many are concerned, the two are inseparable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_4;Permanently Established;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_church_4_desc;A formal head of the Bogomil faith has been established, creating a true Church of Bogomilism. More than that, Bogomilism will be recognized as an independent faith by fellow Christians, looked upon more as a schism from Orthodoxy than a heresy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
maz_wealth_group_desc;One of Mazdak’s primary teachings was that the Zoroastrian priesthood oppressed its people, and hoarded its wealth. He believed that wealth should be shared, and espoused ideas of egalitarianism that were way ahead of his time. A ruler of proper faith should, by the Mazdakite faith, set aside a large share of its taxes for the people – and force his vassals to do the same.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_1_desc;The Mazdakite nobility must put aside a token amount of wealth for the people – more for show than anything substantial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_2_desc;The Mazdakite nobility must put aside a portion of their wealth and taxes in order to subsidize the poorest of the poor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_wealth_3_desc;A large amount of the taxes and wealth possessed by the nobility must go towards the people – the building of shelters for the poor, the standard granting of gifts for the ill-favored, and the construction of hospitals for the sick.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
waldensian_charity_law_desc;All Waldensian rulers are required to give a healthy amount of their wealth to the poor. The question is whether the act is an optional one, or whether such charity will be required by law amongst the ruler’s vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
wald_charity_1_desc;Charity amongst rulers is required by law – portion of all taxes are given to the poor, something that is appreciated by the Waldensian Church but rather disliked among feudal vassals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bad_omen_desc;This character pored through the Quran and saw terrible things about to happen in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
bogomilist_government_desc;This is a form of government which is essentially feudal, and thus reliant upon the oaths between liege and vassal, but also melded with the precepts of the Bogomil faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
expelled_d_army_light_desc;This ruler, or a predecessor, expelled the Army of Light from their realm and seized their castles. It is a blight on the family’s reputation that will remain with them forever.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

court_anarchy_desc;The ruler has been made into a veritable prisoner by his own court—a regent controls his affairs, and his court runs rampant with infighting as they vie with each other for influence. Whether or not he will be able to regain control is unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druze_juhhal_desc;Known as “the Ignorant,” Juhhal are members of the Druze faith who have taken the Pact of Time, but have not been initiated. These are the majority of the faithful: they are not granted access to the Druze holy literature or allowed to attend the initiated religious meetings of the ‘uqqal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druze_uqqal_desc;A member of the Druze initiates, known as ‘uqqal, who alone know Druze doctrine, participate fully in the Druze religious services, and have access to Druze scripture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hurufi_mystic_b_desc;This man has discovered the hidden knowledge written in the Quran.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
imamah_claimant;Isma‘ili Claimant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
imamah_claimant_desc;According to Isma‘ili doctrine, the line of Imams flowed from Ja‘far through his eldest son Isma‘il and down through his line to this character, regardless of whether Isma‘il had or had not died before his younger brouther Musa al-Kadhim. As the current claimant, it is believed he is destined to rise up and restore the Caliphate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
kharijite_kafir_desc;This character has been declared “kafir,” or an apostate to the Kharijite faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_master_desc;This character has rid himself of all internal demons and is now considered “Perfect,” which means they now have license to indulge in any manner of behavior they wish and not be held morally accountable for it. They are considered teachers by other Messalians, who consider them more holy than priests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
accuse_as_kafir_desc;Accuse your liege, §Y[Root.GetBestName]§!, of being kafir, and thus a decadent [Root.GetManWoman] in violation of Allah’s laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
appoint_messalian_patriarch_desc;The Bishopric of Antioch is considered to be the highest title within the Messalian hierarchy, and the bishop who holds it can be effectively annointed as the head of the entire Messalian faith – provided he or she has the backing of a sufficiently powerful Messalian ruler, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
become_muslim_mystic_desc;While Christians regard Muslim mysticism as sorcery or even worse, those esoteric scholars who attempt to study the Quran and penetrate its many mysteries are well-regarded and welcome in almost every court. Many have dedicated their entire lives to such study, even to the detriment of their own health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
begin_formalize_bogomilist_church;Begin Formalization of the Bogomil Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
begin_formalize_bogomilist_church_desc;The formalization of the Bogomil faith into a structured organization supported by the state will take a great deal of work. It can be done slowly over time, or more quickly provided you have both the respect and piety. Either way, there are likely to be repercussions from those of the faithful who resist such changes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
cathar_consolamentum_desc;The only sacrament of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith, the Consolamentum represented a purification of the faithful from sins gained throughout their life. Once the ritual baptism had occurred, the faithful [Root.Religion.GetName] would be considered “Perfect” and be expected to live a life of celibacy – as well as to spread the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith further. Most did not receive Consolamentum until their deathbeds, but the zealous would take the sacrament much earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
claim_imamah_desc;The descendants of Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad, hold a special place amongst those of the Isma‘ili faith – the head of the dynasty is considered the Imamah, and primary claimant to the Imamate. With no clear Imamah currently existing, it falls on the head of the Fatimid dynasty to step forward and assume the responsibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
church_of_st_bogomil_desc;Surely a faith which has come as far as Bogomilism deserves a church to rival those of St. Peter’s Basilica and the Hagia Sophia?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

create_bogomilist_patriarch_desc;Annointing a Bogomil Elder will mean true respect for Bogomilism as an independent religion, no longer treated as a heresy of Orthodox Christianity. It will also stabilize the religion and mean that other benefits, such as claims and divorces, can now be provided by the Elder.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
declare_as_kafir_desc;Declare §Y[Root.GetBestName]§! to be §Ykafir§!, an apostate in violation of Allah’s laws.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
declare_religious_emancipation_desc;The [Root.Religion.GetName] faith is considered a heresy, but perhaps that need not be the case. With an officially-ordained head of our religion and a [Root.Religion.GetName] champion of sufficient esteem to sponsor a place for negotiations to take place, perhaps we could divorce ourselves from heresy and be treated as an offshoot from our parent religion instead… if they will let us go without a fight, that is. Doing so means giving up on any hope of supplanting them as the “official” faith, but is that what we really want?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
druze_pact_of_time_desc;The coming of age ceremony for all Druze adults, in it the Druze signs the Charter known as the Mithaq Walley El-Zaman – the “Pact of Time Custodian.” The Charter embodies all human souls after death, allowing for their reincarnation in the next life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

force_formalize_bogomilist_church;Force Bogomil Formalization;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
force_formalize_bogomilist_church_desc;A leader of enough piety and standing could force a formalization of the Bogomil faith far more quickly than would otherwise be possible. This will mean any repercussions from the faithful will happen immediately, but so will the reforms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
formalize_bogomilist_church;Formalize the Bogomil Faith;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
formalize_bogomilist_church_desc;Enough work has been done to organize the Bogomil faith for it to now be considered to have a structure of its own. Note that this will mean that feudal lords will no longer be able to hold temples, and that temple holders will be considered Bogomil bishops as elsewhere in Christendom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

hurufi_study1_desc;Scholarship and mysticism represent the highest levels of Muslim faith and achievement.

Such risk is the price one must pay for enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Such risk is the price one must pay for enlightenment.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
hurufi_write_epic_poem_desc;The pinnacle of achievement for a true poet would be to write an epic Islamic poem – something that would ensure your fame for all eternity. Whether you could complete it in your lifetime is difficult to say, as certainly it will take many years to finish, but if you do…?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

lollard_revoke_temple_named;Revoke [Root.GetTitledFirstName]’s Religious Titles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
lollard_revoke_temple_desc;Revoke all temple holdings from §Y[Root.GetBestName]§! if [Root.GetSheHe] is not Lollard or has the Wicked Priest trait. If [Root.GetSheHe] is both Lollard and doesn’t have the Wicked Priest trait, §Y[From.GetBestName]§! will get a strong claim to all titles of higher than Baron tier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

manichean_patronize_art_desc;Religious artwork is important to the Manichaean faith. Mani himself was known as “the Artist,” and Manichaean rulers would donate their wealth to support the creation of new artistic works.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_restore_priesthood;Create Mazdakite Priesthood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_restore_priesthood_desc;While Mazdak railed against the oppression of the Zoroastrian priesthood, now that his teachings have spread across all of Persia perhaps the time has come to institue an organized priesthood of our own – one that espouses the egalitarian principles upon which the Mazdaki faith is founded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
mazdaki_choose_patron_deity_desc;The Mazdakites teach there are four Powers that bring Light into the World: Discernment, Understanding, Preservation, and Joy. Any adult member of the faith may embrace one of these Powers in an attempt to achieve eventual perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_abandon_prayers_desc;The process of driving out one’s demons is an exhausting process, perhaps even dangerous. While it would mean failure in the eyes of the Holy Spirit, perhaps it is best to put aside the prayers for a time and restore your strength before attempting them again.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_become_master_desc;To one of the Messalian faith, achieving perfection – meaning one is free of the demons who bring with them mortal sin – is the holiest state to which one can aspire. It means being one with God, and will make the Messalian a teacher of their fellow faithful. It also means that one is free of any obligations to mortal concepts of morality and constraint, as the idea of perfection is literal. If you are one with God, how can you possibly sin?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_castrate_desc;Follow in the path of the Saint Sabas Apokopos, one of the founders of the Messalian sect, and castrate yourself. In the eyes of the Messalian faith, it is one of the most holy acts a follower is capable of – though naturally it can only be done once.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_choose_patron_saint_desc;The Messalians believe that there are four important patron saints that watch over them: Saint Nestor, Saint Adelphius, Saint Addai, and -- perhaps most shocking to other Christians – Lucifer the Lightbringer. It is important that a Messalian choose one of these patron saints to watch over them, and it will be the patron to whom they direct their daily prayers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
messalian_expel_daemon_desc;The Messalians believe that sins are literal demons that exist within the body, and that the only way to rid oneself of sin is to endure ritual fasting and rigorous prayer until the demons are forced out. This is the only way that one can achieve perfection and unity with God, after which point all of one’s obligations to morality and piety are considered irrelevant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
miaphysite_embrace_alexandrine_desc;Those of advanced learning in eastern churches tend to lean towards one of two schools of theology – the Alexandrine School emphasizes the allegorical interpretation of scriptures, and tends to a more pragmatic approach towards the advancement of science and thought… even if that can lead to conflict with the zealous.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
miaphysite_embrace_antiochene_desc;Those of advanced learning in eastern churches tend to lean towards one of two schools of theology – the Antiochan School leans toward a more literal interpretation of scriptures, and focuses more on tradition and the advancement of culture… even if that can lead to conflict with those of a more cynical or progressive view.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
observe_bema_feast_desc;One of the most important religious observances of Manichaeism, the bema feast takes place annually at the vernal equinox. It is meant to celebrate the passion of Mani, and this year you have decided it shall be a feast to remember! Note that, if you enact the decision outside of the yearly timeframe in which the feast occurs, it won’t actually begin until the equinox.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

restore_court_order_desc;Perhaps it’s not possible to salvage the authority of your throne. It might require a bloody purge of your court, and that will require you to be strong… very strong, indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
vassalize_religion_head_desc;The leader of the [Root.Religion.GetName] acts as a veritable exile – without a temple to call their own, a demesne from which to call out to the faithful, and without real legitimacy in the eyes of the world. We could offer that by granting a place within the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], something that would be of benefit to us all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
yazidi_peacock_feast_desc;Tawûsgeran, also known as “Circulation of the Peacock,” is an important Yazidi festival where Qewals and other religious dignitaries visit Yazidi villages, bringing the senjaq, sacred images of a peacock made from brass symbolising Tawûsê Melek. These are venerated, taxes are collected from the pious, sermons are preached and holy water distributed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_226;The Manichaeans believed there were five “Shekhinah,” which are the elements where the Divine dwells. Each Manichaean can choose an element upon which to focus, and once chosen that focus cannot be changed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTOPTB_emf_heresy_228;And so the heresy grows more powerful…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_229;The growing power of the Manichaeans can no longer be denied. With the aid of [Root.GetTitledName], a group of fanatics, peasants, and madmen have now banded together to create their own army, to smite heathens and infidels and to protect the righteous. They call themselves the Army of Light, and their holy mission is to fight for the cause of good – in the eyes of the Manichaeans – and drive darkness out of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_234;Religious leaders from the province of Baghdad are complaining about the prevelance of Manichaean worshippers. “It is horrible that you can not walk down a street in Baghdad without tripping over half a dozen Manicheans. Why should we let these infidels continue to live while they tempt others away from the true faith?” They are asking that something be done, lest this become an even greater problem in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_235;The province of Baghdad was once the center of the Manichaean faith, home to [manichean_leader.GetTitledName] who is their leader. After complaints by [Root.Religion.GetName] worshippers, [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] has begun a slaughter of all Manichaeans in the region – beginning with [manichean_leader.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] and so ravaging the population that the scholar Ibn al-Nadim reports only finding five remaining in the entire city after the pogrom was finished. The Manicheaean position of Archegos now lies empty, and looks to remain so.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_250;Only the Elect – those who are devoted to the Manichaean faith – are invited to take part in a ritual meal, which both symbolizes the life of Mani and the theology of the Manicheans. To take part is a great honor.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_257;It is said that the Abbasids would never have been able to seize the caliphate without the aid of the great Persian general, Abu Muslim, who in the end was rewarded for his service with death -- executed on the order of Caliph Al-Mansur. Resentment for this perceived betrayal has long simmered as resentment among the Persian people, resentment which has now broken out in open rebellion. A peasant leader by the name of Babak, aided by his capable wife Banu, an effective general and archer in her own right, has risen up to free his nation from the unjust rule of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]… and has already attracted a massive following, enough to present a real threat to the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTNAME_emf_heresy_258;The Mazdakite Priesthood;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_258;Although the Prophet Mazdak always railed against the corruption of the Zoroastrian Priesthood, and his followers have never had an official structure to speak of, now that the faith has risen to such prominence under [Root.GetTitledName] it seems the time has come to give it to them. With [new_mazdaki_leader.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] chosen as the new [new_mazdaki_leader.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] of the [new_mazdaki_leader.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName], the Mazdakite faith has entered a new era, with a priesthood rivalling that of the Zoroastrians from which they once stemmed… and have, perhaps, now exceeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_259;The Mazdakites teach there are four Powers that bring Light into the World: Discernment, Understanding, Preservation, and Joy. Any adult member of the faith may embrace one of these Powers. in an attempt to achieve eventual perfection.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_260;You have begun preparations for the Tawûsgeran festival, also known as the “Circulation of the Peacock.” You send out messengers with invitations to your Yazidi vassals, expecting all to come and honor Melek Taus, greatest among the seven angels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_279;The pilgrimage to Lalish, a site just outside of the bustling city of Mosul, is one of the most important journeys a Yazidi can undertake. There one attends the Feast of the Assembly, and returns filled with the spirit and strength of the Seven Archangels… or so the story goes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_281;You arrive in the bustling city of holy Mosul, and it is not long before you make your way to Lalish, a mountain valley village not far to the north. This sleepy place is where the Yazidi faith truly began, and as the Feast of the Assembly unfolds, prayers offered to the Seven Archangels up in the heavens, you marvel at the conical roofs of Sheikh Adi ibn Musafir’s tomb. The rest of your stay will be spent in Mosul, but you cannot help but feel overcome at having taken a path so many have walked before you.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_285;There are many who claim the Yazidi to be devil-worshippers, due to their veneration of the Peacock Angel they call Melek Taus or Shaytan. This has led the Yazidi to be considered Muslim heretics for countless generations, even though their religion incorporates syncretic elements of not only the Muslim faith but also Gnosticism and Zoroastrianism. Now, with [Root.GetTitledName] having risen to such power, [Root.GetSheHe] has declared the Yazidi to be their own faith and no heresy – and [Root.GetSheHe] has the prestige to be listened to. In the end, it may change nothing save to the Yazidi themselves, but even so it is a sign as to just how far they have come since the ancient days of worshipping at hidden temples in the Kurdish foothills.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

His advisors have taken control of the court, and already cracks have begun to appear in its authority over the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle]’s vassals. Whether [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] will be able to regain control or whether the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetFullName] will crumble into anarchy is currently unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

Other Islamic jurists claim the boy is clearly a fraud, but to his followers he is the one they have been waiting for and now they flock to his banner as he begins his crusade to wrest the [ismaili_revolt_target_title.GetFullName] from the hands of [ismaili_revolt_target.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1973;With your assumption of the Isma‘ili caliphate, Isma‘ili faithful from across many realms have flocked to [Root.Capital.GetName] to fight under your banner.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_1976;While the line descending directly from Isma‘il, the Sixth Imam of the Shi‘ites, was thought to have been lost, a new claimant has arisen in the form of [Root.GetBestName]. While not a direct descendant, [Root.GetSheHe] is indeed a descendant of Fatimah and claims that is enough for [Root.GetHerHim] to carry the banner of the Isma‘ilis.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2011;A Cathar heresy has been brewing for some time, begun by numerous ascetic priests who espouse strange beliefs regarding there being two Gods—a “Good God” who created the spiritual realm, and an “Evil God” who created the material realm and all of humanity, and the reason why all humans are filled with sin—but with the gathering of these priests at a council in the province of [From.GetName], the heresy has begun to spread like wildfire. At this council, the priests codified many of their laws and spread territories into “bishoprics,” and they have since gained many followers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTC_emf_heresy_2011;They are led by a Bogomil, I hear;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2015;A discredited seminary student by the name of John Wycliff has been spending his time in [new_lollard_stronghold.GetName], preaching his heretical thoughts on the Bible to the peasants—specifically that the Catholic Church must be reformed. He speaks out against the greed and excess of Catholic priests, the Sacrament of the Eucharist, and the over-emphasis of reverence paid to Christian idols. Many peasants, having no love for the corrupt priests of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], have embraced his teachings and the Lollard heresy is spreading like wildfire throughout the countryside.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2016;As you men storm the church, they discover a rich cache of icons and relics, all of it gilded in gold and surely belonging to [From.Owner.GetTitledName].

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2017;Several years ago, [Root.GetTitledName] ordered a translation of the Bible into the vernacular.

A non-Latin Bible is, then, something of a revelation. Unfortunately for [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal], [Root.GetHerHis] new Bible is not only considered something of a poor translation – with far too many parts obviously swayed by the politics of the day – it is mostly mocked outside of [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and mostly disregarded.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2025;A disgruntled Catholic monk by the name of Brother Angelo has heavily criticized [Root.GetTitledName], and in so doing has rocked the authority of the Roman Catholic Church. Brother Angelo denies that [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal] is legally the pope, as [Root.GetSheHe] has abrogated the Rule of St. Francis – which, according to his doctrine, represented the pure and simple Gospel. He has asserted that all of [Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]’s decrees are thus invalid, and that all Catholics who follow the Pope’s will have lost the grace of God.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2030;A wealthy merchant of [poor_of_lyons.GetName] by the name of Pierre Valdes gave up all his earthly possessions and began wandering the countryside as a preacher after a brush with death.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2110;A heresiarch by the name of “Bogomil,” which may not even be his true name, has appeared in the province of Kossovo, capitalizing on the anger of the locals following their conversion from pagan ways. His teachings of a heresy that seems to combine Christianity with a combination of Gnostic dualism and anti-church sentiment has caught on extremely quickly in both Kossovo and the surrounding areas, presenting a challenge to [Root.GetTitledName]’s rule as well as to the authority of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith.

They finally agreed to a common liturgy, so that ceremonies performed across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] use a common set of prayers and rituals, and that this will be taught to new Perfecti going forward.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2115;Up until now, Bogomil priests have all used different letters and gospels in their preaching, a result of the scattered and disparate beginnings of the faith. At the behest of [Root.GetTitledName], the “[Root.GetOnlyDynastyName] Bible” has been written and agreed upon as canon by a council of Perfecti in [Root.Capital.GetName].;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2116;In order to continue the process of formalizing the Bogomil faith, the scattered preachers and Perfecti will need to be gathered together in councils.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2118;A Bogomil Perfecti has approached you with an idea for continuing your efforts to formalize your faith: the construction of several seminary schools across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], each teaching a common and unified version of Bogomilism dogma to future preachers.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2120;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]’s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the Bogomil faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have been rewarded today after a prominent Perfecti in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] issued a proclamation of support. The [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] is a [Root.GetManWoman] of piety and faith, he says, and thus [Root.GetHerHis] desires should be heeded.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2121;[Root.GetTitledFirstNameNoRegnal]’s tireless efforts to promote the transition of the Bogomil faith from a disorganized movement into a structured religion have advanced after the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] gave a speech in [Root.Capital.GetName] that has been widely disseminated and complimented by pious scholars.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2122;A recent treatise written by [Root.GetTitledName] [Root.GetHerHim]self on the vital importance of Bogomilism’s continued reforms has spread far and wide across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], and received a lot of recognition from the faithful as being full of wisdom. Indeed, some are viewing the text as a new addition to Bogomil canon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2123;Recently, a new sect of Bogomil has been spreading in [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName], one that advocates a radically different version of the faith. Normally this would not be an issue, as the sect is not popular, but it has proven disruptive to your efforts to formalize Bogomilism, as their presence has prompted other sects to follow suit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2124;A recent revival of Bogomil traditionalism has taken hold in [PrimaryTitle.GetName], with numerous preachers cropping up who actively deride your efforts to reform the faith as being exactly the same sort of tyrannical structure they rebelled against in the first place. Needless to say, this has not been helpful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2125;A prominent Perfecti in [demand_province.GetName] has publicly begged that you slow down, if not outright stop, the process of Bogomil reform. The common folk are confused by these contradictions, he says, and continuing down this path too quickly will only bring down God’s wrath.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2126;A set of crop failures and other disasters that has fallen one of your provinces in recent months has stirred the ire of several fiery preachers in the area.

Sadly, their words have taken hold amongst many.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2127;A prominent Perfecti has recently taken issue with your desire to reform the Bogomil faith, pointing out a number of flaws in your argument without ever actually saying outright that your intention is solely to grab power and force the faithful into compliance.

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2128;[Root.GetTitledName]’s recent victory against [From.GetTitledName] in [Root.Location.GetName] has been hailed as a major victory for Bogomilism, and has spread the notion that perhaps the continuing reforms of the faith have God’s favor after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2129;[Root.GetTitledName]’s recent staggering loss against [From.GetTitledName] in [Root.Location.GetName] has been hailed as a sign that the ongoing reforms of the Bogomil faith do not have God’s favor after all.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_2130;Bogomil Faith Organized;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2130;In its inception, the Bogomil faith was only loosely organized. They didn’t believe in formal churches, and opposed any kind of formal hierarchy – this has all changed with the leadership of [Root.GetTitledName], whose piety and status as a Perfecti has encouraged all members of [Root.GetHerHis] faith to reconsider their resistance to feudal structures. Bogomils across the world are now more formally organized, though many still do not consider them a true religion, and they remain opposed to any kind of formal church that emulates the Orthodox priesthood. Even so, there are many that object to even these changes, saying that Bogomilism has betrayed its own roots at a powerful [Root.GetLordLady]’s behest.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME_emf_heresy_2131;Bogomil Faith Formalized;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2131;Though the faithful were hardly ready for it, Bogomilism has now been formalized as a structured religion thanks to the leadership of [Root.GetTitledName]. While many see [Root.GetHerHis] leadership and piety as being worthwhile to follow, there are many who claim [Root.GetSheHe] has dragged the faith too fast into something which too much resembles the very kind of tyrannical structures they once abandoned. Preachers throughout [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] are questioning how far this will go, and whether the [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetRulerTitle] has not perhaps betrayed Bogomilism’s principles for the sake of power. Whatever the case, Bogomil priests are now unified under a common liturgy, a single sacred text, and operate out of temples – far more than the disparate heretics from where they sprang.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2132;After a long and arduous process of reform, the Bogomil faith can now truly be considered a formal religion. Under the considered leadership and piety of [Root.GetTitledName], Bogomil priests are now unified under a common liturgy, a single sacred text, and operate out of temples – far more than the disparate heretics from where they sprang. While some question whether these reforms betray the principles upon which Bogomilism was founded, far more say they were agreed to by all and with due consideration. The faith is now ready to come into its own.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2135;Construction has begun in Tarnovo on the planned Church of St. Bogomil, a structure to rival St. Peter’s Basilica or the Hagia Sophia. It will surely be a marvel of construction, and a bastion of faith for all Bogomils across the world!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_emf_heresy_2137;As evidence of just how far the Bogomil faith has come, the Church of St. Bogomil has completed construction in the city of Tarnovo. A majestic structure to rival even the most potent Christian cathedrals, the church has become a bastion of faith for all Bogomils across [Root.PrimaryTitle.GetName] and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5026;The rain has been pouring down for days, and it’s almost impossible to travel the roads. Why does [Root.GetHighGodName] punish His faithful pilgrims so?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_SoA_5061;The stories of other pilgrims all spoke of how impressive this place is. Now that you can see it with your own eyes, you can only join in their praise. You are glad that you came here, to one of the [Root.Religion.GetName] faith’s most holy places.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
