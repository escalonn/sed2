BM_LECHFELD;Battle of Lechfeld;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_LECHFELD_DESC;For almost a century, the Magyars had encroached upon the eastern border of East Francia, venturing at times even as far as Lotharingia and Italy and threatening the security of the fledgling German kingdom. At last, Otto the Great, upon hearing news of an impending Magyar invasion, mustered the hosts of Christendom to make a final defense against the hordes of the greatest military power in Europe. The battle that would ensue would decide the fate of two nations, from which would emerge Otto, the restorer of the empire of the Romans and of Charlemagne, and set into motion the establishment of the Christian Apostolic Kingdom of Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_AGE_OF_KINGS;The Age of Kings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_AGE_OF_KINGS_DESC;Centuries of turmoil have waxed and waned since the glory of the empires of the Caesars in the west and the Caliphs in the east as wars and anarchy take their toll upon the known world. However, as squabbling warlords and belligerent nomads begin to carve out kingdoms and principalities, even fragile and destructive human ambition can offer hope. Great men rise to power, wielding authority divinely granted and by their swords and scepters in the name of peace, order, and stability. But even as an age of darkness seems to pass, there are still many whose plots and machinations can bring even kings to heel…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_NEW_MILLENNIUM;A New Millennium;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_NEW_MILLENNIUM_DESC;Christian priests and scholars speak of the passing of a new millennium, a testimony of the enduring legacy of Christ and Holy Mother Church. However, an even greater testament rests upon the brow of Stephen, recently crowned King of the Hungarians, whose sword now champions the Christian faith that had once trembled in fear at the hooves of his fathers' hosts. Far to the east on the fringe of the Islamic world, Mahmud of Ghazna has received caliphal investiture with the honorific title Yamin al-Dawla ("Right Hand of the State"), making the lowly son of a Turkic slave a legitimate ruler of the large province of Khorasan. Between these two lie a world divided among caliphates, kingdoms, and empires each vying for dominion over the others – which of them will establish their supremacy in this strange new world?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SPERCHEIOS;Battle of Spercheios;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SPERCHEIOS_DESC;Two armies face each other across the river Spercheios, one shouldering the burden of upholding an ancient legacy now threatened by an impetuous barbarian host, and the other with spirits high from victorious conquests but far from their homeland. A tsar-to-be ponders his next move while a loyal domestikos makes a desperate effort to outmaneuver his formidable enemy under the cover of night as the die is cast on the fate of two great empires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_CANUTE_THE_GREAT;Cnut the Great;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_CANUTE_THE_GREAT_DESC;The death of Harald II of Denmark in 1018 ushers in the creation of the fabled North Sea Empire as Harald's brother Cnut, recently crowned King of England after his victory over the Anglo-Saxons, inherits the throne of Denmark as well. While the Vikings dominate the northern coasts of Europe, the Byzantines observe the Rurikid civil war with interest, seeking to extend their influence after having finally vanquished their old enemy the Bulgarian Empire and restored their borders to the banks of the Danube. Across the Mediterranean, the Fatimids maintain a firm hold on the Levant, albeit under the iron grip of the deranged Caliph al-Hakim. On the eastern border of the Muslim world, the Ghaznavids rise from their humble origins eastward into the rich lands of the Punjab and westward into Persia while balancing their fragile relationships with the Turks of the steppes, whose great saga of migration and conquest is about to unfold…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_TAIFA_KINGS;The Taifa Kings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_TAIFA_KINGS_DESC;After two decades of continuous succession crises, the Caliphate of Córdoba is no more – not even as a figurehead regime. Andalusia now enters a new era of independent local strongmen and opportunists, who would become known as taifa ("faction") kings. Southern Andalusia is dominated by various Berber tribes, including the Berberized sayyid Hammudid dynasty, that had been invited there as caliphal auxiliaries in recent decades. The eastern coast of Andalusia has been taken over by former saqaliba ("Slavic") slaves of al-Mansur ibn Abi 'Amir (Almanzor), the real power behind the throne responsible for greatly degrading caliphal authority decades prior. Elsewhere, local Arab notables like the former vizier Jahwar in Córdoba have been elected to lead city councils, while descendants of the early Arab and Berber settler tribes such as Banu Tujib and Dhunnunid continue to hold sway over frontier territories.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_DANDANAQAN;Battle of Dandanaqan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_DANDANAQAN_DESC;Oghuz nomads led by sons and grandsons of Seljuk entered Transoxiana in the early 11th century, serving as auxiliary troops for the Samanids and Karakhanids. The Seljuks were eventually allowed to settle in northern Khorasan, where they were to protect the Ghaznavids' northern borders. However, what began as a compromise ended in disaster as the Seljuks, having taken control over cities in northern Khorasan, rose up against their Ghaznavid masters and soundly defeated them at the Battle of Dandanaqan in May 1040. The Ghaznavid court is in full retreat, leaving Khorasan open to further Seljuk incursions. Meanwhile, the Sultan's heir apparent Mawdud fortifies his defenses in Balkh, fully intent on meeting this new upstart threat head-on. The Ghaznavids will not go down without a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_AGE_OF_THE_NORMANS;Age of the Normans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_AGE_OF_THE_NORMANS_DESC;The Normans have recently established an independent county in Byzantine Apulia, and the young William the Bastard is just coming of age in Normandy and beginning to make his mark on the world. Native rule has been restored to England, with Edward the Confessor taking the throne as Magnus the Good of Norway ascends to power in Denmark following the death of Harthacnut, son of Canute the Great. Meanwhile, in the East, the Muslim world is on the brink of war as the Seljuks rise to power in Khorasan following the Battle of Dandanaqan, turning their eyes to the rich heartlands of Persia and Iraq. The hegemony of the Ghaznavids and the Buyids may soon give way to the rise of a younger and stronger Turkic empire that would transform the face of the Middle East and spark the beginning of a clash of civilizations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SELJUKS_IN_BAGHDAD;The Seljuqs in Baghdad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SELJUKS_IN_BAGHDAD_DESC;In December 1055, Tughril of the Seljuk Turks entered Baghdad, capturing the last Buyid emir of Iraq and putting an end to Buyid supremacy over the Sunni caliphate. In welcoming the new protector of the Sunni faith, caliph al-Qa'im bestowed upon Tughril many titles, including "King of East and West" and "Pillar of the State". Decades of instability during the last decades of the Buyids notwithstanding, Baghdad remains in great peril: surrounded by Shi'ite rulers sympathetic to the Fatimid caliph in Egypt, the city is under threat of a former Buyid slave general called Basasiri, who is seeking to take over Baghdad in the name of the Fatimid caliph. Tughril's enemies are many – the fate of Baghdad and that of the fledgling Great Seljuk Empire is far from certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ISAAC_KOMNENOS;Isaac Komnenos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ISAAC_KOMNENOS_DESC;After the Emperor Michael VI managed to alienate the Empire's leading generals and bungled the defense of the frontier against the Pechenegs to the north and the Seljuks to the east, the military aristocracy rallied around the most experienced and skilled commander in their ranks, Isaac Komnenos, proclaiming him emperor in the summer of 1057. Isaac immediately sat out to reform the military strength of the Empire and cut much of the frivolous spending of the court to restore strength and order to a rapidly declining Byzantine state. However, enemies abound both within and without, and only time will tell whether his attempts at reform will preserve the rule of the Romans or accelerate its descent into oblivion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
