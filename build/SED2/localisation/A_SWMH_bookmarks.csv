BM_LECHFELD;Battle of Lechfeld;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_LECHFELD_DESC;For almost a century, the Magyars had encroached upon the eastern border of East Francia, venturing at times even as far as Lotharingia and Italy and threatening the security of the fledgling German kingdom. At last, Otto the Great, upon hearing news of an impending Magyar invasion, mustered his men to make a final defense against the hordes of the greatest military power in Europe. The battle that would ensue would decide the fate of two nations, from the ashes of which would emerge Otto, the restorer of the empire of the Romans and of Charlemagne, and set into motion the establishment of the Christian Apostolic Kingdom of Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

BM_CANUTE_THE_GREAT_DESC;The death of Harald II of Denmark in 1018 ushers in the creation of the fabled North Sea Empire as Harald’s brother Cnut, recently crowned King of England after his victory over the Anglo-Saxons, inherits the throne of Denmark as well. While the Vikings dominate the northern coasts of Europe, the Byzantines observe the Rurikid civil war with interest, seeking to extend their influence after having finally vanquished their old enemy the Bulgarian Empire and restored their borders to the banks of the Danube. Across the Mediterranean, the Fatimids maintain a firm hold on the Levant, albeit under the iron grip of the deranged Caliph al-Hakim. On the eastern border of the Muslim world, the Ghaznavids rise from their humble origins eastward into the rich lands of the Punjab and westward into Persia while balancing their fragile relationships with the Turks of the steppes, whose great saga of migration and conquest is about to unfold…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_DANDANAQAN;Battle of Dandanaqan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_DANDANAQAN_DESC;Oghuz nomads led by sons and grandsons of Seljuk entered Transoxiana in the early 11th century, serving as auxiliary troops for the Samanids and Karakhanids. The Seljuks were eventually allowed to settle in northern Khorasan, where they were to protect the Ghaznavids’ northern borders. However, what began as a compromise ended in disaster as the Seljuks, having taken control over cities in northern Khorasan, rose up against their Ghaznavid masters and soundly defeated them at the Battle of Dandanaqan in May 1040. The Ghaznavid court is in full retreat, leaving Khorasan open to further Seljuk incursions. Meanwhile, the Sultan’s heir apparent Mawdud fortifies his defenses in Balkh, fully intent on meeting this new upstart threat head-on. The Ghaznavids will not go down without a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_AGE_OF_THE_NORMANS;Age of the Normans;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_AGE_OF_THE_NORMANS_DESC;The Normans have recently established an independent county in Byzantine Apulia, and the young William the Bastard is just coming of age in Normandy and beginning to make his mark on the world. Native rule has been restored to England, with Edward the Confessor taking the throne as Magnus the Good of Norway ascends to power in Denmark following the death of Harthacnut, son of Canute the Great. Meanwhile, in the East, the Muslim world is on the brink of war as the Seljuks rise to power in Khorasan following the Battle of Dandanaqan, turning their eyes to the rich heartlands of Persia and Iraq. The hegemony of the Ghaznavids and the Buyids may soon give way to the rise of a younger and stronger Turkic empire that would transform the face of the Middle East and spark the beginning of a clash of civilizations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SELJUKS_IN_BAGHDAD;The Seljuqs in Baghdad;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SELJUKS_IN_BAGHDAD_DESC;In December 1055, Tughril of the Seljuk Turks entered Baghdad, capturing the last Buyid emir of Iraq and putting an end to Buyid supremacy over the Sunni caliphate. In welcoming the new protector of the Sunni faith, caliph al-Qa’im bestowed upon Tughril many titles, including “King of East and West” and “Pillar of the State”. Decades of instability during the last decades of the Buyids notwithstanding, Baghdad remains in great peril: surrounded by Shi‘ite rulers sympathetic to the Fatimid caliph in Egypt, the city is under threat of a former Buyid slave general called Basasiri, who is seeking to take over Baghdad in the name of the Fatimid caliph. Tughril’s enemies are many – the fate of Baghdad and that of the fledgling Great Seljuk Empire is far from certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ISAAC_KOMNENOS;Isaac Komnenos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ISAAC_KOMNENOS_DESC;After the Emperor Michael VI managed to alienate the Empire’s leading generals and bungled the defense of the frontier against the Pechenegs to the north and the Seljuks to the east, the military aristocracy rallied around the most experienced and skilled commander in their ranks, Isaac Komnenos, proclaiming him emperor in the summer of 1057. Isaac immediately sat out to reform the military strength of the Empire and cut much of the frivolous spending of the court to restore strength and order to a rapidly declining Byzantine state. However, enemies abound both within and without, and only time will tell whether his attempts at reform will preserve the rule of the Romans or accelerate its descent into oblivion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
