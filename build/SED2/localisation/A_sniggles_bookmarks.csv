BM_HUNGARY;Hungary and Croatia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_HUNGARY_DESC;The death of Helen the Fair, the childless Queen of Croatia, passes her kingdom on to her brother Ladislaus, King of Hungary. The union of Hungary and Croatia brings strength to the Magyars, but will Ladislaus and this new-formed Balkan union be able to stand the test of time? Elsewhere in the world, Yusuf, the Almoravid Emir of Mauretania, has begun uniting the peoples of North Africa and southern Iberia. He seeks to contest—and if possible, reverse—the conquests that the kingdoms of León and Castile have managed against the Muslims of Iberia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_ISLES;King of Dublin and the Isles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_THE_ISLES_DESC;Godred Crovan, of both Norwegian and Irish descent, has finally succeeded in expanding his Kingdom of Mann and the Isles to include his birthright, the Kingdom of Dublin. The day of the Norwegian conquerors is over, dead with the failure of Harald Hardrada at Stamford Bridge, but Godred Crovan believes in turning back that clock. From his foothold in Dublin, he seeks to expand and name himself Ard Rí ua Éire, High King of Ireland. But Godred is not without other troubles. He holds lands that Malcolm Dunkeld calls his own, and the Scottish king will not back down from his own birthright easily.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_NORWAY_1;The Collapse of the Isles;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_NORWAY_1_DESC;The kingdom that Godred Crovan worked his entire life to create is no more. He is dead of the plague and his kingdom has fractured. While King Magnus III of Norway has reasserted hegemony over much of Godred’s old land, Galloway and Dublin have both declared independence from the Norwegian King. The north of Albion lies in flux: will Magnus be able to avenge his defeated grandfather Hardrada and terrorise the shores of Albion once again, or will Edgar, the young King of Scotland, be able to use this transition to his advantage?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_EDGE_OF_KNIFE;The Edge of the Knife;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_EDGE_OF_KNIFE_DESC;The Western World stands upon the edge of a knife. In Iberia, the Almoravid Emirate is nearing total victory, with Alfonso of León and Castile barely holding on to the north of Spain, and the kingdoms of Aragon and Navarre and the County of Barcelona barely surviving at the French border. Across the Mediterranean, although the Komnenoi have taken the throne and fight valiantly against the Turk, Sultan Kilij Arslan holds much of Anatolia under his grasp, and looks with greedy eyes toward Lesser Armenia. Iberia or Anatolia, Castile or Byzantium: will the heathens succeed in breaking the iron walls of Christianity to finally breach the interior of Europe?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ANTIOCH;The First Crusade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ANTIOCH_DESC;Having been concluded with the bloody fall of Jerusalem, the First Crusade brought about a serious disruption in the stability of the Levant. In the north, the Principalities of Antioch and Edessa are in tension with not only each other but also with their Muslim and Armenian neighbors. To the south, the nascent Kingdom of Jerusalem is balanced against the weakened Fatimid Caliphate, the large Emirate of Damascus, and myriad minor atabegs dividing it from the Princes to the north. Can the Catholics hold out long enough to unify, or must another Crusade be called to secure a Catholic Holy Land?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_JERUSALEM;Jerusalem at Its Height;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_JERUSALEM_DESC;Jerusalem stands strong and proud. The Principality of Antioch has been absorbed and the kingdom has expanded inland, toward the Sinai peninsula and Damascus. Although Jerusalem’s size and strength goes a long way to secure Catholic dominance in the Levant, everything is far from guaranteed. Damascus and Aleppo still stand as guards against the massive Seljuk Empire to the East, and the Fatimid Caliph smarts over the losses Egypt suffered during the First Crusade. Jerusalem has many enemies, and few friends. In the distance, a scream for Jihad sounds…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_KOMNENOS;Manuel Komnenos;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_KOMNENOS_DESC;Manuel Komnenos reigns in Byzantium, and Hungary looks on in fear. Ever the opportunist, Manuel had long ago concluded a pact with the King of Hungary, Stephen III, whereby Stephen’s brother Béla would be educated at the Imperial court in Constantinople. Manuel had as-of-yet been without legitimate male issue, and intended Béla to be married to his daughter Maria, to eventually rule alongside her as Emperor. Sensing opportunity, however, Manuel decided to move against Stephen and press his son-in-law’s claims on the duchies of Dalmatia and Croatia. With those titles secured, Béla is now a landed vassal of Manuel, and the heir to the Kingdoms of Croatia and Hungary. Although the Komnenos line looks as though it may slip from the Imperial seat unless Manuel takes immediate action, the Byzantine Empire stands to grasp the greatest prize it has had in its sights since the Komnenoi took the throne: the buffer between the Holy Roman and Eastern Roman Empires.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SERBIA;Fall of the Komnenoi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SERBIA_DESC;The Komnenoi have fallen from the imperial throne, and Byzantium is falling with them. The newly-formed Kingdoms of Serbia and Bulgaria have declared their independence from the Byzantine crown, the Seljuk Sultans of Rum press against the Empire’s restored borders in Anatolia, and an independent Béla III rules in Hungary and Croatia. All of Manuel Komnenos’s dreams have come to naught, but this is a time of opportunity, for those wise enough to see it. Alexios Komnenos, an infant member of the royal Komnenos dynasty, rules in Trebizond. If he can gather support enough to press his claim on Byzantium, the young Komnenos can work to restore the golden age his family’s untimely fall from grace brought to a close.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_IBERIA;The Iberian Campaign;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_IBERIA_DESC;Iberia is balanced between the Muslims and Christians. In the north the Catholics divide the land between five Kingdoms: Portugal, León, Castile, Navarre, and Aragon. To the south, the Muslims are unified once more under the emergent Almohad caliphate. The Christians may have shifted the balance in their favor, however: the Almohad Caliph Abu Ya‘qub Yusuf suffered multiple defeats, losing his life in Iberia while returning from his last campaign. Is this a time of opportunity and growth for the Christians, or can the new Almohad caliph muster enough strength to fight back?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_TURMOIL_IN_THE_EAST;Turmoil in the East;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_TURMOIL_IN_THE_EAST_DESC;The Fourth Crusade has left Byzantium crippled, and its prior vassal states do not fare much better. Three powerful dukes vie for control of Greece proper, and only one of them is Greek. The hatred between the Latin and Byzantine Empires has not abated, but neither has progress been made toward discovering the final victor in their struggle. Glory and titles are there, for a man strong enough to seize them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FRACTURE;The Fall of Rûm;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FRACTURE_DESC;Plagued by the Mongols to the east and succession disputes, the Sultanate of Rûm has collapsed. In its place a half-dozen beys have risen. The Byzantine Empire, labored and barely standing, has recovered Constantinople, but its strength to do more than that is in question. Many other powers have interest in the east, among them Naples and the still-warring dukes in Greece. A great nation must rise from the ashes of Rûm—or Byzantium—and whoever succeeds in unifying the disparate peoples of the Aegean shall have power enough to challenge the gateguard of Europe, Hungary.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SWEDEN;Magnus IV;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SWEDEN_DESC;Magnus IV, by election King of Sweden and by birthright King of Norway, has temporarily united much of Scandinavia under his rule. Unless Magnus proves to be an exceptional King it is unlikely that the union will live beyond him, but there are those who whisper of an Empire of the North, with Magnus I at its head…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ITALY;The Italian Campaign;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ITALY_DESC;The Holy Roman Empire is in decline, and Italy has finally been completely freed from its grasp. Dukes war with counts, mayors with doges. Who will unite Italy—or will Italy be united at all?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SALADIN;Saladin;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SALADIN_DESC;Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub—better known to the Western world as Saladin—has taken the throne of Egypt for his own. Previously the servant of the Emir of Damascus, Nur ad-Din, Saladin has broken with his former benefactor to usurp the rule of Egypt from the Shia Fatimids during a period of crisis, choosing opportunity over longstanding friendship with the Emir, and causing great tension in the Crusader states. Although Saladin is likely to be preoccupied for a time with the Emir of Aleppo, not to mention his own Shia subjects, it is only a matter of time until the holy warrior turns his eyes toward the states of Jerusalem and Antioch…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ANARCHY;The Anarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ANARCHY_DESC;The Anarchy was a period of early English history in which the dynasty of the Norman conqueror William broke down and was replaced by the cadet house of Plantagenet. It began when the second Norman King of England, Henry I, died without legitimate issue. Although Henry attempted to place his daughter Matilda on the throne, the lords of England would not have it. In his daughter’s place, a male descendent of William through the female line, Stephen de Blois, was declared king. Support for Stephen was not absolute, however, and there were many loyalists who sided with Matilda in the succession. Matilda herself was married to the first son of King Fulk of Jerusalem, Geoffrey of Anjou, later to be known as Geoffrey Plantagenet. Geoffrey has managed to conquer Normandy in her name, and the succession crisis between the powerful vassal and the weak King Stephen of England appears to be inevitable.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_LITHUANIA;House Gediminaitis Restored;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_LITHUANIA_DESC;After the brief reign of the usurper-king Treniota, the people of Lithuania have seen fit to restore the house of King Mindaugas to the throne, establishing his first son Vaišvilkas as Grand Duke. Vaišvilkas has expanded Lithuania to the east, and in so doing has inadvertantly made Lithuania one of the de facto gateguards of Europe alongside the Kingdoms of Poland, Hungary, and Bulgaria, and the Grand Duchy of Novgorod. Although Vaišvilkas’s realm is still relatively small, his pious Christianity buys him time and potential support from other Christian rulers. If he can gain that support and use it to hold off the Mongol horde,the ambitious young Grand Duke of Lithuania might well be able to recover some of his ancestral lands lost to the Teuton knights…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_HABSBURG;The Habsburgs;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_HABSBURG_DESC;Rudolf of Habsburg, current King of Germany, has put down Ottokar II of Bohemia, his only rival for the Roman-German throne. With Ottokar’s defeat much of his lands have defaulted back to the crown, including the duchy of Austria, which Rudolf has entrusted to his son, Albert. Although the succession is secure and a new age has begun with the Habsburg control of Austria, not all is well in the Empire. The Kingdom of Sicily has broken out of the firm control with which Frederick II held it, and has even begun expanding, conquering much of the coast of Greece and even Provence. Inspired by the succession crisis and Sicily’s success, many small states of northern Italy have declared independence. History calls the Habsburgs one of the most successful houses of the Medieval period, but now they face the potential collapse of the Empire’s control of the Italian peninsula. Stop the collapse, for the glory of the House of Habsburg!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_PLANTAGENET;Holy Roman Empire in Turmoil;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_PLANTAGENET_DESC;Richard Plantagenet, through bribes to the German electorate, has been elected as King of the Romans. His election is not a simple one, however. It raises serious questions about the future of the Holy Roman Empire. The powerful Plantagenet England is a strong ally of the Emperor—one that he may need, for the Holy Roman Empire is dangerously imbalanced. Conrad of Hohenstaufen, King of Sicily and great-grandson to Frederick Barbarossa, is an independent elector of the Empire, and jealously seeking a return of his family’s titles. His control of the Duchy of Swabia means the Kingdom of Sicily has lands in central Germany, weakening the Empire and making Conrad a valid successor. If danger from outside Kings is not enough, Ottokar II of Bohemia has expanded toward the Adriatic Sea, massing power and support for his own potential election. Can the House of Plantagenet maintain control through another election?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_CASTILLE;The Union of Castile and León;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_CASTILLE_DESC;Through the deposition and exile of his brothers, Sancho of Castile has come to inherit his family’s divided kingdoms of Galicia and León. With northern Iberia united against the Islamic threat to the south there is greater hope for a Catholic peninsula than before, but nothing is certain. Personal unions can be broken, and Muslims can unite against a common threat just as their Catholic brethren have.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_LEVANT;Seljuk Conquest of the Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_LEVANT_DESC;Against even other Muslims the Seljuk horde does not stay its hand. Subduing Oghuz hordes that made themselves masters of Syria and Palestine in previous decades, Malik Shah of the Seljuk Empire has brought Seljuk supremacy over the Levant, bringing an end to Fatimid hegemony in the area. The Seljuks reign over the Levant and the holy cities of Mecca and Medina has passed into Seljuk hands, smashing the balance of power in the east and making the Seljuks one of the most powerful states in Eurasia.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_KIEV;Kiev and Novgorod;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_KIEV_DESC;For a brief period, the princes of Kiev and Novgorod stand balanced in the frigid north of Russia. Both are powerful and both wish to unite Rus’ in a more permanent union, but only one can succeed. To the south, problems in Byzantium are alleviated by the fracture of the Seljuk royal house between the seat of Persia and Anatolia, but this, too, is an imperfect solution—the Sultanate of Rum is still immensely powerful. Nevertheless, with the immediate pressure of the Seljuk Empire diverted from Byzantine possessions, it may be possible to take advantage of the weakened position of the Egyptian Caliph on the North African coast…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ALMORAVID;Last of the Almoravids;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ALMORAVID_DESC;Half a century since Almohad takeover of the Maghreb and southern Iberia, the Almoravids are all but gone from the political scenes of the Muslim west. In fact, there remain the last descendants of the Almoravids: Banu Ghaniya, named after an Almoravid princess who married a member of the Masufa tribe of the “veiled” (Tagelmust) Sanhaja Berbers. From their last remaining base of the Balearic Islands, Banu Ghaniya have sought fortune in the seas and beyond. At last, Yahya ibn Ishaq, having succeeded his brother Ali who met his end in Ifriqiya, has occupied Tunisia and Tripolitania and is now preparing his way toward Tunis and the Maghreb. The last of the Almoravids may still have a score to settle with the Almohads.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SELJUK;The Collapse of the Seljuks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SELJUK_DESC;In what proved to be a short-lived period of revival, the Seljuk Empire under Sultan Sanjar has fallen into disorder – triggered by Sanjar’s capture by the rebellious Oghuz bands. Myriad ex-vassals, remaining members of the Seljuq family, and opportunists stand poised to fight over the remnants. The Sunni Caliph, former atabegs, and untold emirs, some of them the last remnants of the old Persian elite, all circle the corpse with hunger—who will win the great prize?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SICILY;Richard and Philip;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SICILY_DESC;Richard the Lionheart and Philip II Augustus stare daggers at one another across the Channel. Through inheritance, bribery, betrayal, and timely conquest the kings of England have been able to occupy well over half of the lands claimed by the French kings, and stand dangerously close to claiming the French crown. Philip II, known to history as Augustus, the monarch that reversed the English conquests and restored French unity and prestige, seems to be in an impossible position—can you replicate his incredible feats? Elsewhere in the world, the Holy Roman Emperor has claimed the Kingdom of Sicily as his dynastic birthright.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ALEXIOS;Alexios Komnenos of Trebizond;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ALEXIOS_DESC;Alexios Komnenos, one of the last remaining members of the Komnenos dynasty, now reigns in his majority in Trebizond. Alexios shares the determination and skill common in his family, and has managed not only to hold Trebizond together in the face of Muslim aggression, but to expand his territory and be crowned Emperor. He has not forgotten his claim to Constantinople, nor has he forgotten his dynasty’s golden age upon the throne, lost now to imperial incompetence and the shameful Fourth Crusade… but perhaps not lost forever. Now is the time for the Komnenoi to reclaim their titles, their honor, their birthright. Now is the time for the return of the rightful Emperors!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ANUSHTIGINID;The Seljuk Successors;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ANUSHTIGINID_DESC;The Anushtiginid Shahdom has finally restored a degree of order to northern Persia by subduing territories once contested among former Seljuk vassals and Oghuz nomads for over 50 years. Despite great success, the path to glory is not certain for the Anushtiginids. Former Seljuk atabegs, a resurging caliphate, and curious rumors of riders to the east are enough to keep any wise Sultan awake through the long nights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_MALI;Mali United;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_MALI_DESC;The lands that would come to be known as the Empire of Mali have been united under its first Mansa. What this means for the future, and for the safety of the Marinid Sultan’s southern border, remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_NAPLES;The Sicilian Vespers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_NAPLES_DESC;In the bloody aftermath of the Sicilian Vespers, a war in which the Aragonese King attempted to assert his claim to the Kingdom of Sicily, the kingdom is divided. His son rules in the island of Sicily, or Trinacria, and claims rights to the entirety of the kingdom. On the mainland, the son of the old king of Sicily looks with jealousy on the island that should by rights be his. Both sides of the conflict have powerful allies, the king of Trinacria protected by the Kings of Aragon and Castile, and the king of Naples supported by Hungary and Croatia—a new war will not be an easy one. Also on the Iberian peninsula, Philip IV Capet has come to inherit the Kingdom of Navarre, and can likewise be counted in the Iberian struggle. Who will move when, and what will they move against?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ILKHANATE;Ascension of Mahmud Ghazan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_ILKHANATE_DESC;Overthrowing his cousin Baydu, Ghazan has ascended to the throne of the Ilkhanate. As the first Ilkhan to publicly convert to Islam, Ghazan made his embrace of Islam known throughout his realm by adopting the name Mahmud. Whether Ghazan will succeed in turning the Ilkhanate into a major Muslim realm remains to be seen.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_POLAND;The Polish-Bohemian Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_POLAND_DESC;Due to the untimely death of the Polish monarch without a favorable heir, Wenceslaus II Premyslid of Bohemia has been crowned king in place of another Piast. This gives Wenceslaus—heir to Ottokar, and all the desire for revenge against the Hohenstaufens that comes with being his son—a great deal of power in Europe. If Wenceslaus is given time to consolidate and expand it is unlikely the Holy Roman Empire will ever be able to reassert its authority over Bohemia, with its control of the Italian peninsula already crumbling. The time to move is now!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_GH;Fall of Kiev;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_GH_DESC;Marching westward with a seemingly unstoppable force, Batu’s Mongol horde has captured Kiev, the heartland of the Kievan Rus’. More than thousands lie dead in Kiev, as if foreshadowing what is to come in the lands farther west. Will Kiev be the last city to suffer such fate? Or will the Mongols stop their bloody conquest at some point?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_LITHUANIA_FORMED;Lithuania Unites!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_LITHUANIA_FORMED_DESC;With the Teutonic Order occupying their historic lands in the West and the Golden Horde destroying the Rurikids to the East, the myriad tribes of Lithuania have finally seen fit to unite under one king for their better protection, by necessity. Mindaugas is a strong ruler, but his kingdom is not. Lacking many of his historic lands, those having been usurped by the Teutonic Order, and being only a few petty duchies away from a full border with the Golden Horde, his fitness will be tested in the coming days. Not only does Lithuania have a vassalage of mixed religions, some Romuva and some Catholic, Mindaugas’s own children are divided in their worship even from his own faith, with his son and heir Vaišvilkas an Orthodox Christian and his second son Daumantas a Romuvan. To secure his lands and carve a future for the Lithuanian people, Mindaugas must calm the religious tension in his realm while seeking alliances to help him in recovering his people’s ancestral land. For Lietuva!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_MONGOL_SPLIT;The Golden Horde and Ilkhanate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_MONGOL_SPLIT_DESC;Following the death of the great Khan Genghis, his realm has split between his heirs. His grandson Batu rules in the north as the Golden Horde, while his youngest son Tolui rules in the south as the Ilkhanate. Although the division of these realms may well make the Mongol menace weaker on the offensive, their dynastic alliance will certainly make what lands they have already claimed nigh-impenetrable…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_TWO_ERIKS;The War of the Two Eriks;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_TWO_ERIKS_DESC;On the death of King Stenkil, his son Erik ascended the throne of Sweden as Eric II. As soon as the young Eric II ascended the throne, Eric III of Uppland declared a war to place himself, youngest—and bastard—son of King Emund, on the throne in a conflict which would come to be known as the War of the Two Erics. Eric II is Catholic, whereas Eric III is pagan, one of the last living remnants of the old faith. Can Eric III restore the old religion and the rule of his house to a land that has abandoned both?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_CHAGATAI;Rise of the Chagatai Khanate;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_CHAGATAI_DESC;For decades, Chagatai’s descendants were placed in a subservient position to the house of Ögedei in the east. Ögedei’s grandson Kaidu acted as de facto suzerain of the Chagatai Khanate for nearly half a century, terrorizing the Chagatai until he found a reliable ally in the newly appointed khan Duwa. But Duwa was not to remain a servant of the Ögedeids: Duwa has defeated Kaidu’s son and successor Chapar, freeing himself from Ögedeid rule. Will Duwa and his descendants manage to preserve their khanate, powerful neighboring khanates notwithstanding?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SCOURGE_OF_GOD;Scourge of God;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_SCOURGE_OF_GOD_DESC;From the East they came, ruthless and without mercy: strange men, dressed in exotic armor and speaking in guttural tongues that none understood. Rumors carried across the Silk Road and the Indian Ocean have told of how Genghis Khan and his invincible Mongol hordes shattered the greatest empires of the known world, from Cathay to Persia. Though Genghis Khan is now dead, the sons and grandsons of Genghis intend to continue his conquests. They have their eyes upon Europe and the rest of the Middle East, and the entire world may be united under the banner of Genghis… if his descendants do not end up fighting among themselves, that is. Perhaps the end of days has finally come at last, a punishment for the sins of the wicked… or perhaps this is God’s greatest test yet for the faithful.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_OSMANS_DREAM;Osman’s Dream;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_OSMANS_DREAM_DESC;With the breakup of the Sultanate of Rum and the decline of the Byzantine Empire, several warlords in Anatolia seek fame and glory in the ensuing power vacuum. Foremost among them is Osman, a pious and brave man. According to a dream he had many, many years ago, great things are in store for Osman and his dynasty. They might even conquer great Constantinople one day. But the journey to Constantinople won’t be easy, and the Byzantine Empire, which has resisted attack after attack for almost a thousand years, will not go down without a fight.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_KHITAN;The Khitan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_KHITAN_DESC;For more than two centuries, the Khitan ruled a vast empire that stretched from Manchuria to Mongolia, perfectly balancing their traditional, nomadic way of life to the north, and the urbane, sophisticated culture of their Chinese subjects to the south. However, overthrown by their Jurchen vassals in the early years of the 12th century, remnants of the once-great Khitan have fled to Central Asia, where they seek to re-create their imperial splendor. Having just defeated the once-mighty Kara-Khanids and the Seljuks, the Khitan under the command of emperor Yelu Dashi now have a foothold in the region. Will they continue their conquests, spreading their Sinicized nomadic culture and their Buddhist faith, or will they settle down, content with re-creating their Chinese empire in Central Asia? All that is certain is that the Khitan are not the first horde to appear suddenly from the far east, nor will they be the last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
