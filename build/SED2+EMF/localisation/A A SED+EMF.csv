BM_THE_OLD_GODS_DESC;§G[NOTE: Preferred, balanced bookmark: William the Conqueror]§! §Y“How the little piglets would grunt if they knew how the old boar suffered.”§! Those were the prophetic last words of the legendary viking §YRagnarr Loðbrók§! as he lay dying in the snake pit of the Northumbrian king §YÆlla§!. In 867 the vengeful sons of Loðbrók and their “Great Heathen Army” descended upon the petty kingdoms of Britain to make of §YÆlla§! a “blood eagle.” Meanwhile, two other Norse lords – §YRurik§! and §YDyri§! – were carving out their own rival states among the Slavic and Finnish tribes of the East, laying down the foundations for what would one day become Russia. The Old Gods are still strong and their warriors mighty!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_FATE_OF_ENGLAND_DESC;§G[NOTE: Preferred, balanced bookmark: William the Conqueror]§! September 20, AD 1066. King Harold Godwinson rushes to defend the shores of England against the forces of his traitorous brother Tostig and the Norwegian king Harald III, nicknamed “Hardrada” (Hard Ruler). Meanwhile, William, Duke of Normandy, is about to launch his own invasion of England, sanctioned by Pope Alexander II himself. Saxon, Norse, or Norman – who shall rule Albion?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_NORMAN_CONQUEST_DESC;§G[Preferred, Balanced Bookmark]§! Victorious at the hard-fought Battle of Hastings, William, Duke of Normandy, has proclaimed himself King of England. Displaced Saxon lords rage against the French-speaking usurpers as fief after fief is given to William’s loyal followers. In Anatolia, the Seljuq Turks under the great sultan Alp Arslan are about to invade the Byzantine Empire in a struggle that will determine the fate of Asia Minor…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
BM_KHITAN_DESC;For more than two centuries, the Khitan were the rightful rulers of northern China, perfectly balancing their traditional, nomadic way of life, and the urbane, sophisticated culture of their Chinese subjects. However, overthrown by their Jurchen vassals in the early years of the 12th century, remnants of the once-great Khitan have fled to Central Asia, where they seek to re-create their imperial splendor. Having just defeated the once-mighty Karakhanids and the Seljuks, the Khitan now have a foothold in the region. Will they continue their conquests, spreading their Sinicized nomadic culture and their Buddhist faith, or will they settle down, content with re-creating their Chinese empire in Central Asia? All that is certain is that the Khitan are not the first horde to appear suddenly from the far east, nor will they be the last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
